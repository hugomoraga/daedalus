# Plan — Proposal Generation v0 (implementation)

**Status:** Draft · implementation plan for [Spec 002](./spec.md)
**Goal:** Get **real usage evidence** by building the smallest clean vertical slice — not more conceptual modeling.
**Conforms to:** [Technical Principles](../../memory/technical-principles.md) ([ADR-002](../../governance/decisions/ADR-002-adopt-technical-framework.md))
**Version:** 0.2.0
**Last updated:** 2026-06-13

> The `/plan` step: *how* we build Proposal Generation v0. The spec defines *what*. Code is now in scope. We build the leanest **hexagonal** slice that exercises the canonical chain and produces an auditable, replayable event trail.

## 1. Technical context (per the framework)

| Decision | Choice | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Language / runtime | TypeScript on Node.js | confirmed |
| Architecture | **Hexagonal** — Domain / Application / Ports / Adapters | Technical Principles §2 |
| Interface | **CLI** as first driving adapter, **no business logic** | Technical Principles · First-Phase |
| Persistence | **JSONL append-only, one file per tenant**, behind a port | Technical Principles · First-Phase |
| Event store | **`EventStorePort`** + **`JsonlEventStoreAdapter`** | Technical Principles · First-Phase |
| Dependencies | Minimal / zero external (`fs`, `node:test`, `node:util`) | Simplicity First |
| Testing | `node:test` encoding Spec 002 acceptance criteria | — |

---

## 2. Architecture — hexagonal, dependencies point inward

`adapters → application → domain`. The **domain depends on nothing**. The Core / Module / Tenant split lives *inside* `domain/` and `application/`; hexagonal layers are the outer axis.

```
src/
  domain/
    core/
      event.ts               # Event + lineage (tenantId, actor, cause, ts) — value objects
      value-chain.ts         # Core domain events: LeadCreated, LeadQualified, ProposalGenerated
      lead.ts                # Lead aggregate (minimal: unqualified -> qualified)
    proposal-generation/
      proposal-draft.ts      # Draft aggregate + invariants; emits module domain events
      events.ts              # ProposalDraftCreated / ProposalDraftFinalized / ProposalDraftDiscarded
      value-objects.ts       # Money, PricingLineItem, ExpectedValue
  application/
    ports/
      event-store.ts         # EventStorePort  (append / readStream, tenant-scoped)
      draft-store.ts         # DraftStorePort  (load / save / delete the mutable work-area)
    core/
      create-lead.ts         # seed use case  -> LeadCreated
      qualify-lead.ts        # seed use case  -> LeadQualified
    proposal-generation/
      start-draft.ts         # use case: requires a qualified Lead -> ProposalDraftCreated
      add-line-item.ts       # use case: mutate draft (NO event)
      set-scope.ts           # use case: mutate draft (NO event)
      finalize-draft.ts      # use case: ProposalDraftFinalized + single ProposalGenerated(expectedValue)
      discard-draft.ts       # use case: ProposalDraftDiscarded
  adapters/
    persistence/
      jsonl-event-store.ts   # JsonlEventStoreAdapter implements EventStorePort  (driven)
      json-draft-store.ts    # JsonFileDraftStoreAdapter implements DraftStorePort (driven)
    cli/
      index.ts               # driving adapter: parse args -> Command -> use case -> render. NO logic.
  config/
    tenants/tenant-0.ts      # currency, enabled modules, template refs (Tenant layer; NO PII)
.data/                       # gitignored
  tenants/<tenantId>/events.jsonl
  tenants/<tenantId>/drafts/<draftId>.json
```

> **Two ports, both earning their place** (Technical Principles §2, "ports earn their place"):
> - `EventStorePort` — the audit log; clearly swappable (SQLite/Postgres later).
> - `DraftStorePort` — the **mutable work-area**. Per Spec 002 §6, draft edits emit **no events** (to avoid log noise), so the working draft is *not* event-sourced; it needs its own persistence. Isolating it behind a port keeps the domain/use cases pure and the non-event state explicitly contained. This is a deliberate, documented exception to pure event-sourcing, scoped to the draft only.
>
> `id` and timestamp generation are passed into use cases as **injected functions** (not full ports) for test determinism — deliberately not over-abstracted.

### The canonical chain this slice proves
```
Command → Use Case → Aggregate → Domain Events → Event Store Port → JSONL Adapter → CLI
```

---

## 3. CLI commands (v0)

| Command | Use case | Emits / does |
|---|---|---|
| `lead:create --tenant t0 --customer "<name>"` | create-lead | `LeadCreated` (Core seed) |
| `lead:qualify --tenant t0 --lead <id>` | qualify-lead | `LeadQualified` (Core seed) |
| `proposal:start --tenant t0 --lead <id> --template <name>` | start-draft | `ProposalDraftCreated`; creates work-area |
| `proposal:add-item --tenant t0 --draft <id> --label "<l>" --amount <n>` | add-line-item | mutate draft (**no event**) |
| `proposal:set-scope --tenant t0 --draft <id> --text "<s>"` | set-scope | mutate draft (**no event**) |
| `proposal:show --tenant t0 --draft <id>` | (read) | print draft work-area |
| `proposal:finalize --tenant t0 --draft <id>` | finalize-draft | `ProposalDraftFinalized` + **one** `ProposalGenerated(expectedValue)` |
| `proposal:discard --tenant t0 --draft <id>` | discard-draft | `ProposalDraftDiscarded` |
| `events --tenant t0` | (read) | dump append-only log (**the evidence**) |

> **Lead seed is minimal, not a CRM** (review M2): two flat commands existing only to satisfy the "draft starts from a qualified lead" precondition. No pipeline/scoring/capture.
> **Cross-module contract** (review M3 / Spec 002 Q5): `ProposalGenerated` carries optional `expectedValue { amount, currency }` = sum of line items in tenant currency. No pricing engine, no tax.

## 4. Build steps (lean, inside-out per hexagonal)

1. **Domain core** — `Event` + lineage value objects; `value-chain` event factories; minimal `Lead` aggregate. *Pure, no I/O.*
2. **Ports** — define `EventStorePort` and `DraftStorePort` interfaces in `application/ports`.
3. **JSONL adapter** — `JsonlEventStoreAdapter` (append + readStream, tenant-scoped file). Test: append never mutates prior lines; readStream replays in order.
4. **Core seed use cases** — `create-lead`, `qualify-lead`. Test: a draft cannot start from an unqualified lead (AC-1 negative).
5. **Proposal draft domain + use cases** — `proposal-draft` aggregate, value objects; `start-draft`, `add-line-item`, `set-scope`. Test: edits go through `DraftStorePort`, emit no events (AC-4); start emits `ProposalDraftCreated` (AC-1).
6. **Finalize + discard use cases** — `finalize-draft` emits `ProposalDraftFinalized` + exactly one `ProposalGenerated` with `expectedValue` (AC-3, AC-5, R1); draft becomes non-editable. `discard-draft` emits `ProposalDraftDiscarded`, no Core Proposal (AC-6).
7. **CLI driving adapter** — `parseArgs` dispatch; builds Command DTOs; calls use cases; renders. `events` dumps the log. *No business logic in CLI.*
8. **Evidence run + isolation + replay** — scripted end-to-end session (below); two-tenant isolation (AC-9); full-log replay reconstructs state (AC-7).
9. **`.gitignore`** — add `.data/` (no runtime/tenant data, no PII in VC).

---

## 5. The evidence we capture (the point)

A recorded end-to-end session (synthetic data only), committed as a transcript:

```
lead:create   t0 "ACME (mock)"        -> LeadCreated
lead:qualify  t0 <leadId>             -> LeadQualified
proposal:start t0 <leadId> standard   -> ProposalDraftCreated
proposal:add-item t0 <draftId> "Discovery" 1200
proposal:add-item t0 <draftId> "Build" 4800
proposal:finalize t0 <draftId>        -> ProposalDraftFinalized + ProposalGenerated(expectedValue=6000)
events t0                             -> append-only audit trail printed
```

Demonstrates the canonical chain end to end: tenant-scoped immutable events, the read-model draft (no event noise), the clean Module→Core handoff, and the `expectedValue` contract ready for Revenue Visibility. **This is the validation evidence** — concrete, auditable, replayable, and reusable for any future module.

## 6. Acceptance-criteria → test mapping

| Spec 002 AC | Covered by |
|---|---|
| AC-1 (start from qualified lead; reject otherwise) | Steps 4 + 5 |
| AC-3 (expectedValue = sum of items, no tax) | Step 6 |
| AC-4 (edits emit no event) | Step 5 |
| AC-5 (finalize → single ProposalGenerated) | Step 6 (R1) |
| AC-6 (discard, no Core Proposal) | Step 6 |
| AC-7 (auditability; replay reconstructs) | Steps 3 + 8 |
| AC-8 (expectedValue contract for RV) | Step 6 (emits contract; consumed when Spec 001 is built) |
| AC-9 (tenant isolation) | Step 8 |

---

## 7. Scope guardrails (do NOT build in v0)

- No CRM/pipeline/scoring (lead seed = two flat commands).
- No pricing engine, discounts, or tax (`expectedValue` is a sum).
- No sending, e-signature, or contract generation.
- No AI drafting; no orchestration/workflow engine (Phase 2).
- No UI; no real client data / PII (`.data/` gitignored; templates are mock).
- No Revenue Visibility implementation here (v0 only emits the contract).
- From the framework's "avoid" list: no CQRS, sagas, DI framework, relational DB, event bus, etc.

---

## 8. Definition of done (v0)

- The canonical chain `Command → Use Case → Aggregate → Domain Events → Event Store Port → JSONL Adapter → CLI` runs cleanly for the evidence session.
- All acceptance-criteria tests pass (`node --test`).
- Finalize emits exactly one `ProposalGenerated` carrying `expectedValue`.
- State is reconstructable by replaying the JSONL log; two tenants show zero cross-leakage.
- CLI contains no business logic; domain knows nothing of JSONL.
- `.data/` gitignored; no PII in the repo.
